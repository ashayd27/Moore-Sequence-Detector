# Moore Sequence Detector (10010)

A 5-state Moore finite state machine (FSM) implemented in Verilog to detect the binary sequence `10010` in a serial input stream. Supports detection of **overlapping sequences** as well

## Features
- Designed using Moore architecture
- Detects overlapping sequences
- Modular code: separate testbench and FSM
- Outputs waveform dump for simulation tools like GTKWave

## How to Run (using Icarus Verilog)
```bash
iverilog -o testbench test/sequenceDetector_tb.v src/sequenceDetector.v
vvp testbench
```
Then open the generated waveform:
```bash
gtkwave waves/waveform.vcd
```

## State Diagram
You can draw the FSM using tools like draw.io or LaTeX TikZ. See `docs/state_diagram.txt` for guidance.
